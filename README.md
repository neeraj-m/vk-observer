# VK.Observer
A simple extension for downloading music from the social network Vkontakte (vk.com).
Adds a download button for each music record anywhere (wall, player, etc.).
No ads, no trackers and spies, open source.

The extension has been removed from the Chrome webstore due to VK complaints.

Furiously welcome suggestions and code review.

`` `
I will be glad if you borrow all or part of the code, you will come to success without becoming an asshole.

### In the current version:

* uploading video with file name as in Vkontakte

* definition of audio recordings deleted at the request of the copyright holder

* download audio recordings by clicking on the download icon in any block and on any page

* adds a download button for each music record anywhere (wall, player, etc.)

* Download all audio recordings for each post by clicking on the button "Download All"

* display file size and bitrate on hover on audio

* adds buttons for downloading video with quality indication (only for videos hosted on Vkontakte servers, does not work with third-party video services like YouTube and others)

* supports scrobbling and adding to your favorite tracks for Last.fm

### In the plans:
